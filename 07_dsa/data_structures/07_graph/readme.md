# Graphs
- Representation (adjacency matrix/list)
- Graph traversals (DFS, BFS)
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal's, Prim's)

## Intro:
- A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

## Traversals of Graph:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Visits nodes level by level.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Visits nodes recursively, exploring one branch at a time.

## Applications of Graphs:
- Social networks
- Maps and navigation
- Scheduling
- Data mining
