# Depth-First Search (DFS):
# DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch 
# before backtracking.
# In grid problems, DFS can be used to explore all possible paths in a maze or find connected 
# components in a grid.


# Find the number of islands in a grid using DFS.
# An "island" is a group of connected 1s (connected horizontally or vertically).
