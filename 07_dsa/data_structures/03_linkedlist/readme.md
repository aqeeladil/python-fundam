# Linked List
- Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List
- Operations (reverse, detect cycles, merge)

## Linked List Intro
- Linear data structure
- Linkedlist is a collection of nodes, where each node is an object containing two things
1. data
2. next_node_address
- LL stores value in non-continuous memory location, unlike arrays.
- Linked lists are dynamic in nature, which means they can grow and shrink in size dynamically and efficiently without the need for resizing or memory reallocation.

## Applications of Linked List:
- Linked lists are used in various applications, including:
- Implementing queues and stacks
- Representing graphs and trees
- Maintaining ordered data
- Memory management

## Why use LL instead of array (write heavy applications)
- In array, insertion & deletion are resource intensive tasks due to shifting of n number of elements. Time complexity O(n)
- But, with linkedlist, we can insert & delete easily Time complexity O(1)


## Disadvantage (read heavy applications)
- In LL, searching is O(n) while in array it is O(1)
