# # Greedy Algorithms
- Activity Selection, Huffman Encoding
- Job Sequencing Problem, Fractional Knapsack


## Intro 
- This algorithm builds up the solution one piece at a time and chooses the next piece which gives the most obvious and immediate benefit i.e., which is the most optimal choice at that moment.
- They are used when a problem exhibits the greedy-choice property and optimal substructure.
