# Dynamic Programming
- Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Coin Change Problem, Fibonacci Sequence

## Intro
- Dynamic Programming is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. 
- By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.
- It relies on the principle of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, where solutions to subproblems can be reused to solve larger problems.
