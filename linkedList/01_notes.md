# Linked List (linear data structure)
- Linkedlist is a collection of nodes, where each node is an object containing two things
1. data
2. next_node_address
- LL stores value in non-continuous memory location, unlike arrays.



# Why use LL instead of array (write heavy applications)
- In array, insertion & deletion are resource intensive tasks due to shifting of n number of elements. Time complexity O(n)
- But, with linkedlist, we can insert & delete easily Time complexity O(1)



# Disadvantage (read heavy applications)
- In LL, searching is O(n) while in array it is O(1)


# Tasks
- Create a Node
- Create a Linked List
- len
- insert at head
- insert at tail (append)
- insert in middle
- traverse/print
- clear
- delete from head
- delete from tail (pop)
- delete by value (remove)
- search by value (find)
- search by index
