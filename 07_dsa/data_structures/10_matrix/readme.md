# Matrix/Grid
- 2D Arrays, Multi-dimensional Arrays
- Operations (traversal, transpose, rotation)
- Pathfinding in grids (DFS, BFS, dynamic programming)
- Applications (maze solving, dynamic programming, graph representations)

## Intro
- A matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements, arranged in rows and columns. 

## Applications of Matrix/Grid:
- Image processing
- Data analysis


## How do you initialize a 2D array in a programming language like Python/Java/C++?

- Python: array = [[0]*4 for _ in range(3)]
- Java: int[][] array = new int[3][4];
- C++: int array[3][4];
