# Data Structure
Data structure is a way to store and organize data efficiently.

Linear datastructure
- array, linkedlist, stack, queue, hashing

Non-linear
- tree, graph

# Array (call by value)
- used to store multiple items of same type in continuous memory location

## Disadvantages of array
- static array (memory wastage due to fixed size)
- homogenous (lack of flexibility to store different datatypes)

## Referential Arrays (call by reference/address)
- heterogenous (can store different datatypes)(unlike that of dynamic array in C++)
- more memory usage & speed is slow bcz here we are first accessing the address and then its actual item where it is pointing.

## Dynamic Arrays
- normally, dynamic array means collection of same type of elements, but in python, lists are dynamic as well as heterogenous. 
- dynamic array is just a concept. In memory, we simply just doubles the size of static array to create more space.


## Python Lists
- python lists are (referential + dynamic) arrays


## Create a class " MyList " that performs following functions
1. len
2. append
3. print
4. indexing
5. pop
6. clear
7. find
8. insert
9. delete
10. remove
