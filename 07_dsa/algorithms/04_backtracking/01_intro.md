- N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver
- Subset Sum Problem, Rat in a Maze, knight's tour


## Intro
- Backtracking algorithm is derived from the Recursion algorithm, with the option to revert if a recursive solution fails, i.e. in case a solution fails, the program traces back to the moment where it failed and builds on another solution. So basically it tries out all the possible solutions and finds the correct one.

- Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that involves exploring all potential solutions to a problem by incrementally building candidates and abandoning them ("backtracking") as soon as it is determined that they cannot possibly lead to a valid solution. 

- This approach is often used in solving constraint satisfaction problems where the solution must satisfy certain conditions.
